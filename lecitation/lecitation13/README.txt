                    A State Machine on the GBA

In this lab, you'll be implementing a state machine similar to what
you'll need to implement for your Homework 10.

When you press A (the z key in VBAM, the emulator `make vba' runs), the
screen should slowly zoom into Calvin Cordozar Broadus, Jr.'s face.
There are 6 frames and they should loop, i.e., 1->2->3->4->5->6->1->2->3->...
We've provided the images and you can draw them with
`drawFullscreenImage3(snoopX);', where X is the frame number you want to
draw. We've provided drawFullscreenImage3() and waitForVblank(), so
don't implement them.

Two rules:

 1. Holding down A MUST NOT quickly cycle through all the states.
 2. You MUST call waitForVblank() exactly once, at the beginning of the
    loop.

Have fun!
